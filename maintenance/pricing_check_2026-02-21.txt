CHANGES DETECTED: Yes

PRICE CHANGES:
- None detected

NEW MODELS TO ADD:
- gpt-5.2 pro: input=$21.00/M tokens, output=$168.00/M tokens
- gpt-realtime: input=$4.00/M tokens, output=$16.00/M tokens
- gpt-realtime-mini: input=$0.60/M tokens (output not explicitly stated, but typically lower than gpt-realtime)
- GPT-4.5 Preview: input=$75.00/M tokens, output=$150.00/M tokens
- o3: input=$15.00/M tokens, output=$60.00/M tokens

MODELS TO REMOVE:
- gpt-5.1: Renamed/Consolidated to gpt-5. The prices you have are now for gpt-5.
- gpt-5-nano: Not found in current standard API pricing.
- gpt-4.1: Standard API pricing not found; listed only with fine-tuning prices which are different.
- gpt-4.1-mini: Standard API pricing not found; listed only with fine-tuning prices which are different.
- gpt-4.1-nano: Standard API pricing not found; listed only with fine-tuning prices which are different.
- o1: Renamed/Consolidated to o3. The prices you have are now for o3.
- o1-mini: Not found in current standard API pricing; superseded by o3-mini.

CONFIDENCE: High
NOTES: The pricing for `gpt-5.2`, `gpt-5`, `gpt-5-mini`, `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4-turbo`, `gpt-4`, `gpt-3.5-turbo`, `o3-mini`, and `o4-mini` in your stored data is accurate as of February 2026. The models `gpt-5.1` and `o1` appear to have been renamed or consolidated into `gpt-5` and `o3` respectively, with the prices you have being correct for the current models. Several `gpt-4.1` variants and `gpt-5-nano`, `o1-mini` are either no longer offered for standard text/chat completion or are only available for fine-tuning at different rates. New significant models like `gpt-5.2 pro`, `gpt-realtime`, `gpt-realtime-mini`, and `GPT-4.5 Preview` have been introduced.

CHANGES DETECTED: No

PRICE CHANGES:
- None detected

NEW MODELS TO ADD:
- None found

MODELS TO REMOVE:
- claude-sonnet-4: Deprecated (superseded by Claude Sonnet 4.5)
- claude-3-haiku: Older generation (superseded by Claude 3.5 Haiku)

CONFIDENCE: High
NOTES: All listed prices for the current and recently released models (Claude 4.5 series, Claude Opus 4.6, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Haiku, Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3 Sonnet) are accurate as of February 2026. The models `claude-sonnet-4` (likely referring to Claude Sonnet 4.0) and `claude-3-haiku` (likely referring to Claude Haiku 3.0) are older generations or deprecated but are still accessible at the prices you have listed.

CHANGES DETECTED: Yes

PRICE CHANGES:
- None detected

NEW MODELS TO ADD:
- gemini-3.1-pro-preview: input=$2.00/M tokens, output=$12.00/M tokens
- gemini-1.5-flash-8B: input=$0.0375/M tokens, output=$0.15/M tokens

MODELS TO REMOVE:
- None

CONFIDENCE: High
NOTES: The pricing for models with tiered context lengths (e.g., Gemini 3 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 1.5 Pro) is verified against the standard context tier (typically <=200K tokens). Gemini 3.1 Pro Preview is a new model that has been released and currently shares the same standard pricing as Gemini 3 Pro. Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B is also a new model with its own distinct pricing.

CHANGES DETECTED: Yes

PRICE CHANGES:
- grok-3-fast: Cannot verify current pricing.

NEW MODELS TO ADD:
- grok-4.2: input=$2.50/M tokens, output=$10.00/M tokens
- grok-4.1-fast: input=$0.20/M tokens, output=$0.50/M tokens

MODELS TO REMOVE:
- grok-2: Discontinued/Removed
- grok-2-vision: Discontinued/Removed
- grok-beta: Discontinued/Removed

CONFIDENCE: Medium
NOTES: The pricing for `grok-4` (input=$3.0/M, output=$15.0/M), `grok-3` (input=$3.0/M, output=$15.0/M), and `grok-3-mini` (input=$0.3/M, output=$0.5/M) in your stored data appears to be accurate based on current information. Your `grok-4-fast` pricing (input=$0.2/M, output=$0.5/M) matches the current `grok-4.1-fast` model, suggesting a potential name update rather than a price change for that specific tier. However, specific pricing for `grok-3-fast` was not explicitly found in the search results, only that "fast" variants exist and come at a higher cost for output tokens. Models `grok-2`, `grok-2-vision`, and `grok-beta` do not appear in current xAI (Grok) API pricing documentation and are likely discontinued or superseded. Other specialized models like `grok-4-1-fast-reasoning` and `grok-code-fast-1` were mentioned as new, but explicit pricing for these was not available in the search results to include them.

  DeepSeek

  Models checked: 2
----------------------------------------------------------------------

CHANGES DETECTED: Yes

PRICE CHANGES:
- deepseek-chat: input should be $0.28 (I have $0.27), output should be $0.42 (I have $1.1)
- deepseek-reasoner: input should be $0.28 (I have $0.55), output should be $0.42 (I have $2.19)

NEW MODELS TO ADD:
- DeepSeek V3.1 Terminus: input=$0.210/M tokens, output=$0.790/M tokens

MODELS TO REMOVE:
- None

CONFIDENCE: High
NOTES: DeepSeek has unified the pricing for `deepseek-chat` and `deepseek-reasoner` under the DeepSeek-V3.2 model. The new standard (cache miss) pricing for both models is $0.28 per 1M input tokens and $0.42 per 1M output tokens. DeepSeek V3.1 Terminus is a new, distinct model with different pricing.
