CHANGES DETECTED: Yes

PRICE CHANGES:
- gpt-4.1-mini: Current standard API pricing for this model is not explicitly found in the search results. The prices listed in official documentation are for fine-tuning.
- gpt-4.1-nano: Current standard API pricing for this model is not explicitly found in the search results. The prices listed in official documentation are for fine-tuning.
- gpt-4o: input should be $5.00 (I have $2.50), output should be $20.00 (I have $10.00)

NEW MODELS TO ADD:
- gpt-5.2 pro: input=$21.00/M tokens, output=$168.00/M tokens
- gpt-realtime: input=$4.00/M tokens, output=$16.00/M tokens

MODELS TO REMOVE:
- gpt-4-turbo: Appears to be superseded or its distinct pricing removed.
- gpt-4: Appears to be superseded or deprecated.
- o1: Not found in current pricing.
- o1-mini: Not found in current pricing.
- o3-mini: Likely superseded by `o4-mini` as `o3-mini` is not explicitly listed with current pricing, but `o4-mini` has matching prices.

CONFIDENCE: Medium
NOTES: There is some conflicting information regarding the exact pricing for `gpt-4o` across different recent sources, though $5.00 input and $20.00 output per million tokens are cited by multiple sources. For `gpt-4.1-mini` and `gpt-4.1-nano`, the prices found in the official OpenAI documentation are explicitly for fine-tuning, not standard API usage, so their standard API pricing status is unclear. The models `gpt-4-turbo`, `gpt-4`, `o1`, and `o1-mini` were not found in the current OpenAI API pricing documentation and are presumed to be superseded or deprecated. Your `o3-mini` model's pricing matches the currently listed `o4-mini` model, suggesting a potential renaming or direct succession.

CHANGES DETECTED: Yes

PRICE CHANGES:
- None detected

NEW MODELS TO ADD:
- claude-sonnet-4-6: input=$3.0/M tokens, output=$15.0/M tokens

MODELS TO REMOVE:
- claude-sonnet-4: Superseded by newer 4.x Sonnet models.
- claude-3-5-sonnet: Superseded by newer 4.x Sonnet models.
- claude-3-opus: Deprecated/Legacy (pricing matches `claude-opus-4.1`, which is a legacy model).
- claude-3-sonnet: Superseded by newer 4.x Sonnet models.
- claude-3-haiku: Deprecated (pricing not found in current models, superseded by `claude-3-5-haiku` and `claude-4-5-haiku`).

CONFIDENCE: High
NOTES: The models `claude-opus-4-6`, `claude-opus-4-5`, `claude-sonnet-4-5`, `claude-haiku-4-5`, and `claude-3-5-haiku` have accurate pricing in your stored data. The `claude-sonnet-4-6` model was released recently (February 2026) and should be added. Several older models from the Claude 3 and earlier Claude 4 series appear to be deprecated or superseded by newer versions, with their names no longer explicitly listed on current pricing pages as active models. The pricing for `claude-3-opus` matches that of `claude-opus-4.1`, which is now considered a legacy model.

NEW MODELS TO ADD:
- grok-4-1-fast-reasoning: input=$0.20/M tokens, output=$0.50/M tokens
- grok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning: input=$0.20/M tokens, output=$0.50/M tokens

MODELS TO REMOVE:

CONFIDENCE: High
NOTES: The `grok-4-fast` model in your list has the same pricing as the newer `grok-4-1-fast-reasoning` and `grok-4-1-fast-non-reasoning` models. I have listed the specific new models for clarity. The search results indicate that older models are being phased out or deprecated.

  DeepSeek
  Reference: https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/pricing
  Models checked: 2
----------------------------------------------------------------------

CHANGES DETECTED: Yes

PRICE CHANGES:
- deepseek-chat: input should be $0.28/M tokens (I have $0.27/M tokens), output should be $0.42/M tokens (I have $1.1/M tokens)
- deepseek-reasoner: input should be $0.28/M tokens (I have $0.55/M tokens), output should be $0.42/M tokens (I have $2.19/M tokens)

NEW MODELS TO ADD:
- DeepSeek V3.1 Terminus: input=$0.210/M tokens, output=$0.790/M tokens

MODELS TO REMOVE:
- None

CONFIDENCE: High
NOTES: DeepSeek has updated its pricing, and both `deepseek-chat` and `deepseek-reasoner` are now powered by DeepSeek-V3.2, sharing the same input and output token pricing. The previous pricing for `deepseek-reasoner` (input $0.55/M tokens, output $2.19/M tokens) corresponds to the original R1 model and is no longer current. A new model, DeepSeek V3.1 Terminus, was released in September 2025 with distinct pricing.
