DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS — Unified Update System
=================================================
All three data files are now GitHub-hosted and auto-updated on startup.

FILES TO DEPLOY:
    1. pricing.json         → Replace in DocAnalyzer_DEV root
    2. models.json          → Copy to DocAnalyzer_DEV root (NEW file)
    3. model_info.json      → Replace in DocAnalyzer_DEV root
    4. pricing_updater.py   → Replace in DocAnalyzer_DEV root
    5. config_manager.py    → Replace in DocAnalyzer_DEV root
    6. push_updates.bat     → Copy to DocAnalyzer_DEV\maintenance\ 
                              (replaces push_pricing_update.bat)

TWO SMALL CHANGES NEEDED IN Main.py:
-------------------------------------

CHANGE 1 — Update the import (around line 266):

    OLD:  from pricing_updater import check_pricing_update_async
    NEW:  from pricing_updater import check_all_updates_async

CHANGE 2 — Update the startup call (around line 822):

    OLD:  self.root.after(delay + 6000, lambda: check_pricing_update_async())
    NEW:  self.root.after(delay + 6000, lambda: check_all_updates_async())


WHAT CHANGED — pricing.json:
    - Added claude-sonnet-4-6 at $3/$15
    - Updated default_model to claude-sonnet-4-6
    - DeepSeek V3.2 unified pricing: both models now $0.28/$0.42
    - Date: 2026-02-21 → 2026-02-25

WHAT CHANGED — model_info.json:
    - Was dated 2024-12-27 with many inaccurate auto_generated entries
    - Now curated with accurate ratings for all models in models.json
    - claude-sonnet-4-6 marked as recommended for Anthropic
    - grok-4-fast marked as recommended for xAI
    - DeepSeek reasoner cost updated to "very cheap" (was "💰💰")
    - Removed 30+ stale auto_generated date-stamped variants
    - Date: 2024-12-27 → 2026-02-25


HOW IT WORKS ON STARTUP:
    1. pricing_updater.py fetches ALL THREE files from GitHub
    2. If any remote file is newer (by _updated date), it's downloaded
    3. load_models() merges GitHub models into the dropdown
    4. _load_model_info() gets the curated Guide data
    5. Cost tracking uses current pricing

WHEN A NEW MODEL LAUNCHES:
    1. Edit pricing.json — add pricing entry
    2. Edit models.json — add model string to dropdown list
    3. Edit model_info.json — add Guide entry (speed/cost/quality/best_for)
    4. Update _updated date in all three files
    5. Run push_updates.bat from maintenance folder
    6. All users get the update on next app startup

BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY:
    - check_pricing_update_async() still works (pricing only)
    - Old push_pricing_update.bat still works for pricing-only pushes
    - model_updater.py API fetch still runs as a secondary mechanism
